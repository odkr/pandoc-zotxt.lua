  {"id":"dotson2016WordWiseNotes","abstract":"It is not uncommon to ask a race and gender-based question of a philosopher of race, only to hear ‘I do race, not gender’. To the ears of many Black feminists, this sounds, to be frank, utterly foolish. Here, I identify three metaphilosophical assumptions, i.e. the disaggregation, fundamentality and transcendental assumptions, that aid in underwriting the ability to use the statement, ‘I do race, not gender’, as a means for avoiding gender-based questions in ‘race talks’. Then, I gesture to a reason to reject the fundamentality and transcendental assumptions, i.e. the promotion of intellectual slumming.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Dotson","given":"Kristie"}],"container-title":"Philosophy Compass","container-title-short":"Philosophy Compass","DOI":"10/gng6nv","ISSN":"1747-9991","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"69-74","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Word to the Wise: Notes on a Black Feminist Metaphilosophy of Race","title-short":"Word to the Wise","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phc3.12268/abstract","volume":"11"}
