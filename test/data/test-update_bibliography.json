To the ears of many Black feminists, this sounds, to be frank, utterly foolish. Here, I identify three metaphilosophical assumptions, i.e. the disaggregation, fundamentality and transcendental assumptions, that aid in underwriting the ability to use the statement, ‘I do race, not gender’, as a means for avoiding gender-based questions in ‘race talks’. Then, I gesture to a reason to reject the fundamentality and transcendental assumptions, i.e. the promotion of intellectual slumming.","title-short":"Word to the Wise","page":"69-74","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016","2","1"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017","7","25"]]},"source":"Wiley Online Library","volume":"11","issue":"2"}]
