To the ears of many Black feminists, this sounds, to be frank, utterly foolish. Here, I identify three metaphilosophical assumptions, i.e. the disaggregation, fundamentality and transcendental assumptions, that aid in underwriting the ability to use the statement, ‘I do race, not gender’, as a means for avoiding gender-based questions in ‘race talks’. Then, I gesture to a reason to reject the fundamentality and transcendental assumptions, i.e. the promotion of intellectual slumming.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phc3.12268/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/phc3.12268","ISSN":"1747-9991","title-short":"Word to the Wise","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Dotson","given":"Kristie"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,25]]},"container-title-short":"Philosophy Compass"}
