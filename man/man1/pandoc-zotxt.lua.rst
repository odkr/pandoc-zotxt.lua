**pandoc-zotxt.lua** - Look up bibliographic data of citations in Zotero

SYNOPSIS
========

**pandoc** **-L** *pandoc-zotxt.lua* **-C**

DESCRIPTION
===========

**pandoc-zotxt.lua** is a Lua filter for Pandoc that looks up citations in
Zotero and adds their bibliographic data to the "references" metadata field
or a bibliography file, where Pandoc can pick it up.

You cite your sources using so-called "Better BibTeX citation keys" (provided
by Better BibTeX for Zotero) or "Easy Citekeys" (provided by zotxt) and then
tell **pandoc** to filter your document through **pandoc-zotxt.lua** before
processing citations. That's all there is to it.

If the "references" metadata field or a bibliography file already contains
bibliographic data for a citation, that citation will be ignored.

CONNECTING TO ZOTERO
====================

Desktop client
--------------

By default, bibliographic data is fetched from the Zotero desktop client,
which must be running when you invoke **pandoc**. This is the faster, easier,
and less error-prone method to lookup citations in Zotero. However, you need
to install the zotxt add-on for the Zotero desktop client to use it.

Web API
-------

Bibliographic data can also be fetched from the Zotero Web API. If you want
to access your Zotero library via the Web API, you need to create a Zotero API
key and set the metadata field "zotero-api-key" to that key.

If you want to fetch bibliographic data from *public* Zotero groups, list the
IDs of those groups in the metadata field "zotero-public-groups". Non-members
must be allowed to access the libraries of these groups (this is what makes
them public). However, you do not need an API key to access them.

The Zotero Web API does *not* allow to search for citation keys other than
Zotero item IDs. Therefore, BetterBibTeX citation keys and Easy Citekeys have
to be translated into search terms: Better BibTeX citation keys are split up
at the first of each series of digits and at uppercase letters ("DoeTitle2020"
becomes "Doe", "Title", "2020"). Easy Citekeys are split up at the first colon
and at the last digit ("doe:2020title" becomes "doe", "2020", "title").

If a search yields more than one item, you need to add its citation key to the
item's "extra" field in Zotero to disambiguate it from the others. Zotero's
"extra" field is a list of CSL key-value pairs; keys and values are separated
by a colon and key-value pairs by a linefeed. Use the key "Citation key" or
the key "Citekey" to add a citation key (e.g., "Citation key: DoeTitle2020").
Case is insignificant, spaces can be replaced by dashes. If you use Better
BibTeX for Zotero, you can add the citation key it has generated by 'pinning'
it. Alternatively, you can cite the source using its Zotero item ID.

CACHING SOURCES WITH A BIBLIOGRAPHY FILE
========================================

Bibliographic data can be added to a special bibliography file, rather than to
the "references" metadata field. This speeds up subsequent processing of the
same document, because that data need not be fetched again from Zotero.

To use such a bibliography file, set the "zotero-bibliography" metadata field
to a filename. If the filename is relative, it is interpreted as relative to
the directory of the first input file passed to **pandoc** or, if no input
file was given, as relative to the current working directory.

The format of the file is determined by its filename ending.

========== ==========
**Ending** **Format**
========== ==========
``.json``  CSL JSON
``.yaml``  CSL YAML
========== ==========

The bibliography file is added to the "bibliography" metadata field 
automatically. You can safely set "zotero-bibliography" and "bibliography"
at the same time.

Items are only added to the bibliography file, not updated or deleted.
If you need to update or delete an item, delete the bibliography file,
so that it will be regenerated from scratch.

CITATION KEY TYPES
==================

You can use citation keys of multitple types:

=================== ========================== =============
**Name**            **Type**                   **Example**
=================== ========================== =============
``betterbibtexkey`` Better BibTeX citation key DoeTitle2020
``easykey``         Easy Citekey               doe:2020title
``key``             Zotero item ID             A1BC23D4
=================== ========================== =============

However, Better BibTeX citation keys are sometimes, if rarely,
misinterpreted as Easy Citekeys, which may cause the wrong item
to be fetched.

If this happens, disable Easy Citekeys by only listing BetterBibTeX
citation keys in the "zotero-citekey-types" metadata field:

.. code:: sh

   pandoc -L pandoc-zotxt.lua -C <<EOF
   ---
   zotero-citekey-types: betterbibtexkey
   ...
   Forces @DoeTitle to be treated as BetterBibTeX citation key.
   EOF


CONFIGURATION
=============

You can control how bibligraphic data is fetched by
setting the following metadata fields:

zotero-api-key
   A Zotero API key. Only applies to the Zotero Web API.

zotero-bibliography
   A bibliography filename. Fetched data is added to this file.

zotero-citekey-types
   A list of citation key types. Citation keys are treated as being of
   any of the listed types only.

zotero-connectors
   One or more Zotero connectors:

   =========  =====================
   **Key**    **Fetch data from**
   =========  =====================
   zotxt      Zotero desktop client
   zoteroweb  Zotero Web API
   =========  =====================

   Data is fetched via the listed connectors only.

   By default, the Zotero desktop client is searched first. If you have
   set a Zotero API key and if the client could not be reached or some
   citations could not be found, the Zotero Web API is searched next.

zotero-groups
   A list of Zotero group IDs. Only the given groups are searched.
   By default, all groups you are a member of are searched.
   Only applies to the Zotero Web API.

zotero-public-groups
   A list of Zotero group IDs.
   The given groups are searched in addition to non-public groups.
   Groups must be public.
   Only applies to the Zotero Web API.

zotero-user-id
   A Zotero user ID. Looked up automatically if not given.
   Only applies to the Zotero Web API.

If a metadata field takes a list of values, but you only want to give
one, you can enter that value as a scalar.

EXAMPLES
========

Look up "DoeTitle2020" in Zotero:

.. code:: sh

   pandoc -L pandoc-zotxt.lua -C <<EOF
   See @doe2020Title for details.
   EOF

Add bibliographic data to the file "bibliography.json":

.. code:: sh

   pandoc -L pandoc-zotxt.lua -C <<EOF
   ---
   zotero-bibliography: bibliography.json
   ...
   See @DoeTitle2020 for details.
   EOF

Interpret "doe:2020title" as a Better BibTeX citation key:

.. code:: sh

   pandoc -L pandoc-zotxt.lua -C <<EOF
   ---
   zotero-citekey-types: betterbibtexkey
   ...
   See @doe:2020title for details.
   EOF

Fetch data from the Zotero Web API, too:

.. code:: sh

   pandoc -L pandoc-zotxt.lua -C <<EOF
   ---
   zotero-api-key: MO2GHxbkLnWgCqPtpoewgwIl
   ...
   See @DoeTitle2020 for details.
   EOF

Fetch data from the Zotero Web API *only*:

.. code:: sh

   pandoc -L pandoc-zotxt.lua -C <<EOF
   ---
   zotero-api-key: MO2GHxbkLnWgCqPtpoewgwIl
   zotero-connectors: zoteroweb
   ...
   See @DoeTitle2020 for details.
   EOF

KNOWN ISSUES
============

A citation key may pick out the wrong item if it picks out a different items
depending on whether it is interpreted as a Better BibTeX citation key or as
an Easy Citekey. Set the 'zotero-citekey-types' metadata field to fix this.

**pandoc-zotxt.lua** creates a temporary file when it adds bibliographic
data to a bibliography file. If Pandoc exits because it catches a signal
(e.g., because you press ``Ctrl``-``c``), then this file will *not* be
deleted. This is a bug in Pandoc (issue #7355) and in the process of being
fixed. Moreover, if you are using Pandoc up to v2.7, another process may,
mistakenly, use the same temporary file at the same time, though this is
highly unlikely.

Zotero v5.0.71 and v5.0.72 fail to handle HTTP requests from user agents
that do not set the "User Agent" HTTP header. And **pandoc** does not.
As a consequence, **pandoc-zotxt.lua** cannot retrieve data from these
versions of Zotero unless you tell **pandoc** to set that header.

Support for accessing group libraries via the Zotero Web API is limited.
They are only searched if no item in your personal library matches.
Also, the "extra" field of items in group libraries is ignored.

SECURITY
========

If you are using Pandoc up to v2.7 and place the auto-generated bibliography
file in a directory that other users have write access to, then they can read
and change the content of that file, regardless of whether they have
permission to read or write the file itself.

CAVEATS
=======

**pandoc-zotxt.lua** is Unicode-agnostic.
