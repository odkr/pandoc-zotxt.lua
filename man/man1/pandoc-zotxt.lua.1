\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] - Look up sources of citations in Zotero
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc\f[R] \f[B]-L\f[R] \f[I]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] \f[B]-C\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] is a Lua filter for Pandoc that looks up
citations in Zotero and adds their bibliographic data to a
document\[aq]s \[dq]references\[dq] metadata field or to a bibliography
file, where Pandoc can pick it up.
.PP
Cite your sources using so-called \[dq]Better BibTeX citation keys\[dq]
(provided by Better BibTeX for Zotero) or \[dq]easy citekeys\[dq]
(provided by zotxt).
Then, while Zotero is running, tell \f[B]pandoc\f[R] to filter your
document through \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] before processing citations.
That\[aq]s all there is to it.
.PP
If a document\[aq]s \[dq]references\[dq] metadata field or a
bibliography file already has bibliographic data for a citation, that
citation will be ignored.
.SH BIBLIOGRAPHY FILES
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] can add bibliographic data to a bibliography
file, rather than to the \[dq]references\[dq] metadata field.
This speeds up subsequent processing of the same document, because that
data need not be fetched again from Zotero.
.PP
To use such a bibliography file, set the \[dq]zotero-bibliography\[dq]
metadata field to a filename.
If the filename is relative, it is interpreted as relative to the
directory of the first input file passed to \f[B]pandoc\f[R] or, if no
input file was given, as relative to the current working directory.
The format of the file is determined by its filename ending:

.PP
The bibliography file is added to the \[dq]bibliography\[dq] metadata
field automatically.
You can safely set \[dq]zotero-bibliography\[dq] and
\[dq]bibliography\[dq] at the same time.
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] only adds bibliographic records to that file;
it does \f[I]not\f[R] change, update, or delete them.
If you need to update or delete records, delete the file;
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] will then regenerate it.
.SH CITATION KEY TYPES
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] supports multiple types of citation keys,
namely, \[dq]Better BibTeX citation keys\[dq], \[dq]easy citekeys\[dq]
and Zotero iterm IDs.
.PP
However, it may happen that a Better BibTeX citation key is interpreted
as an easy citekey \f[I]and\f[R] yet picks out an item, if not the one
that it actually is the citation key of (and vice versa).
That is, citation keys may be matched with the wrong bibliographic data.
.PP
If this happens, you can disable citation keys that you do not use by
setting the \[dq]zotero-citekey-types\[dq] metadata field either to the
citation key type or the list of citation key types that you want to
use.
.PP
You can use the following types:

For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
zotero-citekey-types: betterbibtexkey
\&...

\[at]doe2020Title is now guaranteed to be read as a Better BibTeX citation key.
\f[R]
.fi
.SH EXAMPLE
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc -L pandoc-zotxt.lua -C <<EOF
See \[at]doe2020Title for details.
EOF
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will look up \[dq]doe2020Title\[dq] in Zotero.
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.PP
Zotero v5.0.71 and v5.0.72 fail to handle HTTP requests from user agents
that do not set the \[dq]User Agent\[dq] HTTP header.
And \f[B]pandoc\f[R] does not.
As a consequence, \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] cannot retrieve data from
these versions of Zotero unless you tell \f[B]pandoc\f[R] to set that
header.
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] creates a temporary file when it adds sources
to a bibliography file.
If Pandoc exits because it catches a signal, for example, because you
press \f[B]Ctrl\f[R]-\f[B]c\f[R], then this file will \f[I]not\f[R] be
deleted (this is a bug in Pandoc and in the process of being fixed).
.PP
Moreover, if you are using Pandoc up to v2.7, another process may,
mistakenly, use the same temporary file at the same time, though this is
highly unlikely.
.SH SECURITY
.PP
If you are using Pandoc up to v2.7 and place the special bibliography
file in a directory that other users have write access to, then they can
read and change the content of that file, regardless of whether they
have permission to read or write the file itself.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] is Unicode-agnostic.
