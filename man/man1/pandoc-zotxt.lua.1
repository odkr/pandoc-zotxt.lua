.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] - Look up sources of citations in Zotero
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc\f[R] \f[B]-L\f[R] \f[I]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] \f[B]-C\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] looks up sources of citations in Zotero and
adds them either to a document\[aq]s \[dq]references\[dq] metadata field
or to a bibliography file, where Pandoc can pick them up.
.PP
Cite your sources using \[dq]easy citekeys\[dq] (provided by
\f[I]zotxt\f[R]) or \[dq]Better BibTeX Citation Keys\[dq] (provided by
Better BibTeX for Zotero).
Then tell \f[B]pandoc\f[R] to filter your document through
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] before processing citations; Zotero bust be
running.
That\[aq]s all there is to it.
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] only looks up sources that are defined
neither in the \[dq]references\[dq] metadata field nor in any
bibliography file.
.SH BIBLIOGRAPHY FILES
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] can add sources to a bibliography file,
rather than to the \[dq]references\[dq] metadata field.
This speeds up subsequent processing of the same document, because
sources that are already in that file need not be fetched from Zotero
again.
.PP
You configure \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] to do so by setting the
\[dq]zotero-bibliography\[dq] metadata field to a filename.
If the filename is relative, it is interpreted as relative to the
directory of the first input file given to \f[B]pandoc\f[R] or, if not
input file was given, as relative to the current working directory.
The filename must end with \[aq].json\[aq], because the bibliography is
stored as a CSL JSON file.
.PP
The bibliography file is added to the \[dq]bibliography\[dq] metadata
field automatically.
You can safely set \[dq]zotero-bibliography\[dq] and
\[dq]bibliography\[dq] at the same time.
.PP
The sources in the bibliography file are neither updated nor deleted.
If you want to update the file, delete it.
.SH EXAMPLE
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc -L pandoc-zotxt.lua -C <<EOF
See \[at]doe2020Title for details.
EOF
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will look up \[dq]doe2020Title\[dq] in Zotero.
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.PP
Zotero v5.0.71 and v5.0.72 fail to handle HTTP requests from user agents
that do not set the \[dq]User Agent\[dq] HTTP header.
And \f[B]pandoc\f[R] does not.
As a consequence, \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] cannot retrieve data from
these versions of Zotero unless you tell \f[B]pandoc\f[R] to set that
header.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] is Unicode-agnostic.
