.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
pandoc [...] \-\-lua\-filter pandoc\-zotxt.lua\-0.1.1/pandoc\-zotxt.lua [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBpandoc\-zotxt.lua\fP looks up sources of citations in Zotero and adds
their bibliographic data to the metadata of the document, where it
can be read by \fBpandoc\-citeproc\fP\&.
.sp
You need the \fBzotxt\fP plugin for Zotero. Citations should be inserted
as so\-called easy citekeys. See the documentation of \fBzotxt\fP for details.
.sp
If you want \fBpandoc\-zotxt.lua\fP to call \fBpandoc\-citeproc\fP automatically,
set the metadata field \fBcall\-citeproc\fP to \fBtrue\fP (or another truey value).
This is useful if you are using \fBpanzer\fP, which insists on calling
Lua filters after \(aqordinary\(aq ones.
