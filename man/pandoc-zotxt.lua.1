.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
pandoc \-\-lua\-filter pandoc\-zotxt.lua \-F pandoc\-citeproc
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBpandoc\-zotxt.lua\fP looks up sources of citations in Zotero and adds
their bibliographic data either to a document\(aqs bibliography or its
\fBreferences\fP metadata field, where \fBpandoc\-citeproc\fP can pick it up.
.sp
You should insert citations either as so\-called "easy citekeys" (provided
by zotxt) or as "BetterBibTex Citation Keys" (provided by BetterBibTex). (See
the documentation of zotxt and BetterBibTex respectively for details.) Then
simply run \fBpandoc\-zotxt.lua\fP before \fBpandoc\-citeproc\fP\&. That\(aqs all all
there is to it.
.sp
You can also use \fBpandoc\-zotxt.lua\fP to manage a bibliography.
(It must be a CSL JSON file.) It will then add any source you cite.
.sp
All you have to do is:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Set the \fBzotxt\-bibliography\fP metadata field to a filename.
.IP 2. 3
Add that file to the \fBbibliography\fP metadata field.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBpandoc\-zotxt.lua\fP never updates or deletes entries. If you need to update
or delete an entry, simply delete the bibliography file and let
\fBpandoc\-zotxt.lua\fP regenerate it.
