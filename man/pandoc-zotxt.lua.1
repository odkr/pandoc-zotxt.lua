pandoc-zotxt.lua - Looks up sources in Zotero
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc\f[R] \f[B]-lua-filter\f[R] \f[I]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] looks up sources of citations in Zotero and
adds them either to a document\[cq]s \f[C]references\f[R] metadata field
or to its bibliography, where \f[B]pandoc-citeproc\f[R] can pick them
up.
.PP
You cite your sources using so-called \[lq]easy citekeys\[rq] (provided
by \f[I]zotxt\f[R]) or \[lq]Better BibTeX Citation Keys\[rq] (provided
by \f[I]Better BibTeX for Zotero\f[R]) and then tell \f[B]pandoc\f[R] to
run \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] before \f[B]pandoc-citeproc\f[R].
That\[cq]s all all there is to it.
(See the documentations of \f[I]zotxt\f[R] and \f[I]Better BibTeX for
Zotero\f[R] respectively for details.)
.PP
You can also use \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] to manage a bibliography
file.
This is speeds up subsequent runs of \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] for the
same document, because \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] will only fetch those
sources from Zotero that aren\[cq]t yet in that file.
Simply set the \f[C]zotero-bibliography\f[R] metadata field to a
filename.
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] will then add sources to that file, rather
than to the \f[C]references\f[R] metadata field.
It will also add that file to the document\[cq]s \f[C]bibliography\f[R]
metadata field, so that \f[B]pandoc-citeproc\f[R] can pick up those
sources.
The biblography is stored as a JSON file, so the filename must end with
\[lq].json\[rq].
You can safely set \f[C]zotero-bibliography\f[R] \f[I]and\f[R]
\f[C]bibliography\f[R] at the same time.
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] interprets relative filenames as relative to
the directory of the first input file that you pass to \f[B]pandoc\f[R]
or, if you don\[cq]t pass any input file, as relative to the current
working directory.
.PP
Note, \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] only ever \f[I]adds\f[R] sources to
bibliography files.
It doesn\[cq]t update or delete them.
If you want to update the sources in your bibliography file, delete it.
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] will then regenerate it from scratch.
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.PP
Zotero, from v5.0.71 onwards, doesn\[cq]t allow browsers to access its
interface.
It defines \[lq]browser\[rq] as any user agent that sets the \[lq]User
Agent\[rq] HTTP header to a string that starts with \[lq]Mozilla/\[rq].
.PP
However, Zotero v5.0.71 and v5.0.72 fail to handle HTTP requests from
user agents that don\[cq]t set the \[lq]User Agent\[rq] HTTP header.
And \f[B]pandoc\f[R] doesn\[cq]t.
As a consequence, \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] cannot retrieve data from
these versions of Zotero unless you tell \f[B]pandoc\f[R] to set the
\[lq]User Agent\[rq] HTTP header.
.PP
If you cannot (or rather would not) upgrade to a more recent version of
Zotero, you can make \f[I]pandoc\f[R] set that header, thereby enabling
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] to connect to your version of Zotero, by
passing \f[B]\[en]request-header\f[R] \f[I]User-Agent:Pandoc/2\f[R].
Note, \f[B]\[en]request-header\f[R] \f[I]User-Agent:Mozilla/5\f[R] will
\f[I]not\f[R] enable \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] to connect.
If you must set the \[lq]User Agent\[rq] HTTP header to a string that
starts with \[lq]Mozilla/\[rq], you also have set the HTTP header
\[lq]Zotero-Allowed-Request\[rq].
You can do so by \f[B]\[en]request-header\f[R]
\f[I]Zotero-Allowed-Request:X\f[R].
