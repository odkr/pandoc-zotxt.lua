pandoc-zotxt.lua - Looks up sources in Zotero
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc\f[R] \f[B]--lua-filter\f[R] \f[I]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R]
\f[B]-F\f[R]\ \f[I]pandoc-citeproc\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] looks up sources of citations in Zotero and
adds them either to a document\[aq]s \f[C]references\f[R] metadata field
or to its bibliography, where \f[B]pandoc-citeproc\f[R] can pick them
up.
.PP
You cite your sources using so-called \[dq]easy citekeys\[dq] (provided
by \f[I]zotxt\f[R]) or \[dq]Better BibTeX Citation Keys\[dq] (provided
by \f[I]Better BibTeX for Zotero\f[R]) and then tell \f[B]pandoc\f[R] to
run \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] before \f[B]pandoc-citeproc\f[R].
That\[aq]s all all there is to it.
(See the documentation of \f[I]zotxt\f[R] and \f[I]Better BibTeX for
Zotero\f[R] respectively for details.)
.PP
You can also use \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] to manage a bibliography
file.
This is usually a lot faster.
Simply set the \f[C]zotero-bibliography\f[R] metadata field to a
filename.
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] will then add every source you cite to that
file, rather than to the \f[C]references\f[R] metadata field.
It will also add that file to the document\[aq]s \f[C]bibliography\f[R]
metadata field, so that \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] picks it up.
The biblography is stored as a JSON file, so the filename must end in
\[dq].json\[dq].
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] takes relative filenames to be relative to
the directory of the first input file you pass to \f[B]pandoc\f[R] or,
if you don\[aq]t pass any input files, as relative to the current
working directory.
.PP
Note, \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] only ever \f[I]adds\f[R] sources to
bibliography files.
It \f[I]never\f[R] updates or deletes them.
To update your bibliography file, delete it.
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] will then regenerate it from scratch.
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.PP
Zotero v5.0.71 and v5.0.72 don\[aq]t allow \f[B]pandoc\f[R], and by
extension \f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R], to access its interface.
This is because these versions of Zotero fail to handle HTTP requets
from user agents that don\[aq]t set the \[dq]User Agent\[dq] HTTP
header.
And \f[B]pandoc\f[R] doesn\[aq]t.
.PP
If you cannot (or rather would not) upgrade to a more recent version of
Zotero, you can also pass \f[B]--request-header\f[R]
\f[I]User-Agent:Pandoc/2\f[R] to \f[B]pandoc\f[R].
.PP
Note, from Zotero v5.0.71 onwards, Zotero doesn\[aq]t allow browsers to
access its interface.
It defines \[dq]browser\[dq] as any user agent that sets the \[dq]User
Agent\[dq] HTTP header to a string that starts with \[dq]Mozilla/\[dq].
Put another way, passing, for instance, \f[B]--request-header\f[R]
\f[I]User-Agent:Mozilla/5\f[R] will \f[I]fail\f[R].
If you must set the \[dq]User Agent\[dq] to a string that starts with
\[dq]Mozilla/\[dq], you also have to pass \f[B]--request-header\f[R]
\f[I]Zotero-Allowed-Request:X\f[R].
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R] is partly Unicode-agnostic.
