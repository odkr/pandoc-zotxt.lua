# pandoc-zotxt.lua

**pandoc-zotxt.lua** looks up the bibliographic data of citations in
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and adds them either to the `references`
metadata field or to a bibliography file, where Pandoc can pick it up.
See the [manual](man/man1/pandoc-zotxt.lua.rst) for details.


## Requirements

**pandoc-zotxt.lua** requires

* [Pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org/) ≥ v2.0.3,
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) ≥ v4,
* [zotxt](https://github.com/egh/zotxt/) ≥ v4, and
* [Better BibTeX for Zotero](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) ≥ v4.

It should work under every operating system supported by Pandoc;
it has *not* been tested under Windows, however.

Your version of Pandoc must also support Lua ≥ v5.3 — which it, most likely,
does! By default, Pandoc uses [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) v5.3 since v2.0.3.
However, the Pandoc package provided by your operating system may use an older
version of Lua. Notably, Debian v10 ("Buster") ships with Pandoc v2.2,
but compiles it to support Lua v5.1 only.


## Installation

You use **pandoc-zotxt.lua** at your own risk.

1. Download the
   [latest release](https://github.com/odkr/pandoc-zotxt.lua/releases/latest).
2. Unpack it.
3. Move the `pandoc-zotxt.lua-1.1.0b7` directory to
   the `filters` sub-directory of your Pandoc data directory
   (`pandoc --version` tells you where that is).
4. Symlink or move the file `pandoc-zotxt.lua` from the
   `pandoc-zotxt.lua-1.1.0b7` directory up to the `filters` directory.

If you are running a POSIX-compliant operating system (e.g., *BSD,
Linux, or macOS) and have [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or 
[wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), then you can install
**pandoc-zotxt.lua** by copy-pasting the following commands
into a Bourne-compatible shell:

```sh
( set -eu
  : "${HOME:?}" "${XDG_DATA_HOME:="$HOME/.local/share"}"
  name=pandoc-zotxt.lua vers=1.1.0b7
  url="https://github.com/odkr/$name/releases/download/v$vers/$name-$vers.tgz"
  for data_dir in "$HOME/.pandoc" "$XDG_DATA_HOME/pandoc"; do
    [ -d "$data_dir" ] && break
  done
  filters_dir="$data_dir/filters"
  mkdir -p "$filters_dir" && cd -P "$filters_dir" || exit 69
  { curl --silent --show-error --location "$url" || err=$?
    [ "${err-0}" -eq 127 ] && wget --output-document=- "$url"
  } | tar -xz && ln -fs "$name" "$name-$vers/$name" .; )
```

If you want to use the manual page that ships with this release, you
can add `<Pandoc data directory>/filters/pandoc-zotxt.lua-1.1.0b7/man`
to your `MANPATH`.


## Documentation

See the [manual](man/man1/pandoc-zotxt.lua.rst),
the [source code documentation](https://odkr.github.io/pandoc-zotxt.lua/),
and the [source code](pandoc-zotxt.lua) itself for details.


## Contact

If there's something wrong with **pandoc-zotxt.lua**, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/odkr/pandoc-zotxt.lua/issues).


## Testing

### Requirements

1. A POSIX-compliant operating system.
2. [Pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org/) v2.0.2 to v2.16.2.
3. [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

The test suite has been tested with Pandoc ≥ v2.9.

### Running the tests

Simply say:

```sh
    make
```

Note, some tests report errors even if they succeed. Not every error message
indicates that **pandoc-zotxt.lua** failed a test. If it does fail a test,
`make` will exit with a non-zero status.

### The real-world test suite

By default, the test suite neither connects to a Zotero desktop client
instance nor to the Zotero Web API, but but uses canned responses.
You can force the test suite to connect to a local Zotero database by:

```sh
    make test -e FILTER=./pandoc-zotxt.lua
```

Note, you will have to adapt the test suite to your database (or vice versa;
you can import the references used in the test suite from `tests/items.rdf`).
You will also need to adapt the Zotero item IDs used in test cases to your
Zotero library.
